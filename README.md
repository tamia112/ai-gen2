Project Description – LinkedIn Post Generator
The LinkedIn Post Generator is an AI-powered web application that automatically creates engaging and professional LinkedIn posts based on user input. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app leverages OpenAI’s GPT model to analyze topics, tone, and style, then generates high-quality, ready-to-publish posts in seconds.
Users can specify their post type (e.g., motivational, technical, or announcement), input keywords or a short description, and the system produces a well-structured LinkedIn post with a natural and authentic writing style.
The project demonstrates AI content generation, prompt engineering, and user-friendly UI design, making it a practical tool for professionals, marketers, and creators looking to save time while maintaining impactful communication on LinkedIn.
